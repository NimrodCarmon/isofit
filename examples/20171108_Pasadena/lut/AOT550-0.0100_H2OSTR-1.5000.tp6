Warning from routine GETVIS:  The input value for aerosol optical depth (AOD =   0.01000) is less than the
                              minimum AOD (=   0.02417) for the given atmospheric conditions.  The surface
                              meteorological range (visibility) is being set to its maximum value ( 323.57751 km),
                              the assumed AOD is the minimum value.

 The 550nm vertical optical depth (   0.01000) corresponds to a surface
